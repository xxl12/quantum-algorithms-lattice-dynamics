Quantum algorithms for simulating lattice dynamics 

A collection of Matlab/Python code for the factorization of phonon dynamic matrix 
into analytic polynomials. P=Q^T*Q.

The factorization enables an embedding of the lattice dynamics into a time-dependent 
Schrodinger equation and thus a simple and efficient approach for simulations on quantum 
computers.
